\section{Log}%
\label{log.detailed}
%\label{log.folder}

This folder contains only a big text dialog, which allows the user to enter
some comments of his own, as well as \period itself to put down a written 
history of what changes have been made to the data and what actions have been
taken so far along with the actual time and date.

Saving the log file is possible by selecting the \menuentry{Save log} in the
\menu{Log}.

Printing the log file is also possible selecting the \menuentry{Print log} 
in the \menu{Log}.

\note{Editing/erasing the log is possible in the usual manner.}

\note{On Windows95 there is a limitation of the size of text in a
text dialog. \period will automatically truncate at the start as it 
approaches this limit and write a short header in this case...}
