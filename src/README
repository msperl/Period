Period98 fas the following basic structure:

Data and calculation-layer
Project-layer
User Interface-layer

All data accesses from the UI-layer calls the Project layer,
which itself will then place the appropriate calls to
the datalayer.

The file-structure of the source is as follows:

Data and Calculation-layer:
===========================

d*.cpp d*.h: these files correspond to the Data-layer

dnoise.cpp, dnoise.h: are the implementation of the
                      noise-calculations
dfroutin.cpp, dfroutin.h: are the implementation of
                          the fourier-calculation
dproutin.cpp: is the implementation of the least
              square fit routine 
              (after Bevington,1969 ,
               Data reduction and Error analysis)

Project-layer:
==============

p*.cpp, p*.h: correspond to the Project layer
f*.h: includes the definitions for the text
      to write in the protocol

User Interface-layer:
=====================
x*.cpp, x.h: corespond to the UI-layer
ldialtxt.h: defines most messages that the UI
            will display
lmenu.h: defines the text of the menus displayed in P98
helpref: defines the labels needed to connect to the
         help-system

Extensions to the wxWin library:
================================
wx*.h wx*.cpp

General class definitions:
==========================
str.h, str.cpp: a simple string-class
complex.h, complex.cpp: define a compex variable type
list.h: some list-like-classes
matrix.h, matrix.cpp: a class that defines matrices
                      and some operations with these

Other files:
============
README: this file
Makefile, Makefile.in: these are the files used
                       by make to compile P98
error.h: defines some Macros for error-handling
mscomp.cpp: defines user and date for W95 binaries
mswdefs.h: defines some functions, that are not 
           readily available in MSVC's libc.
constant.h: defines some constants
advanced.h: defines a Variable for which level
            of advanced use should be used
            (needed only for not-export-functions,
             which are implemented, but only
             accessible through the UI, 
             when the -a flag is set when calling P98)
version.h, Version.cpp, Version: these define the
             version of Period98
period98.rc: defines the resources needed to
             compile Period98 for Win95
Period98.sin: shellscript-template to start Period98
              in Unix


Directories:
============
samples: caontains all sample files for P98
bitmaps: contains all bitmaps needed for P98
noneed: contains code not needed to compile
