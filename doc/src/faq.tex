\section{How can I export residuals?}
Please read on the subject of 
\helpref{exporting the Timestring}{timestring.export}. 
There you can select what parts of the timestring you can export.
And this naturally includes the residuals as well.

\section{How can I get other files listed in the file selecter with Unix?}
Basically \period assumes a certain extension of file belongs to a certain
data type. This is reflected in the file selector. 

The pattern used at the begining is not displayed, but the
{\bf File/Filter} text input is empty.

Just enter the new file pattern in there and press return and the
window will be updated.
